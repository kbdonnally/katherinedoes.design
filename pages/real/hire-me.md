Looking for an awesome designer on your next project?

## Here's how to hire me.

### My main offerings

- Designs personal and organization websites
- Something from scratch or spiff up your existing website
- Also available for special project sites and exhibit creation, particularly for academic and justice-oriented needs. 

*Wondering if we're a good match? Check out the info below, or shoot me an email directly at [kbdonnally@gmail.com]({{ site.data.contact.email.url }}).*

### Getting started, finding information

Two main ways to explore the information on what we might contract to do&mdash;choose what feels most natural for your situation; there's no right or wrong answer!

- Option 1: [Link to quiz]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/intake/) to guide you through the best option for you
- Option 2: [Link to menu-style arrangement]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/menu/) <!-- FAKE LINK - 4/17/19 --> of the same information, if you'd prefer a more self-guided approach.

*NB: these are largely the same information; depends on degree of self-guidance desired.*

### Matching up & getting in touch

- Option 3: get in touch directly, either via [contact form]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/contact/) or by [email]({{ site.data.contact.email.url }}).

*NB 2: note that options 1 & 2 both end in an intake form; you're not leaving them out to dry!*

Once the process starts, you'll hear from me within about five business days. Then, we can finalize choices, personalize them to your needs, set up payment, and get going.

### A final note

This is a collaborative process throughout, as much as you want or have time for it to be. Your website should reflect *you*, and I highly encourage having fun with your real aesthetic opinions&mdash;this is a space for creativity, with a professional designer as the bumper lanes.

I look forward to hearing from you and working together. :) *- Katherine Donnally*
