# Intake Form

*Create contents for quiz where people can figure out what it is they need.*

*Available as 'menu' form too - both should take you to the contact form and the quiz should be able to enter your results in it so people don't even have to report it to you.*

## Quiz Contents Draft (4/17/19):

1. Do you have a...
    A. Personal website
    B. Organization website
    C. Other
2. Does your website...
    A. Already exist, but needs big changes
    B. Need to exist and doesn't yet
    C. Just needs a tune-up, a makeover, a new look
3. About how many pages does your website need work on?
    A. Uh, what now how many? (Aka: it's cool if you're not sure about this question. It's just nice to know if people do know the answer.)
    B. 1-5
    C. 5-10
    D. 10-20
    E. 20+
4. Do you or your organization have any current opinions or requirements for the look of the website that you'd for sure like to keep? Enter answer below.
5. What do you really dislike about the website right now and wish you could change?
6. What are 3 websites (similar to yours or completely different!) that make you really happy when you go to them? Or that you enjoy the experience of using? (You don't need to know why you like them! It's just helpful as a reference, like getting a sense of someone's taste in movies by watching some of their favorites.)
7. What is your budget for this project?
8. Any dates by which part of this project absolutely must be finished? If so, when?
9. How would you describe the purpose of your website, including any purpose you'd like it to fulfill when this project is over but it's not currently fulfilling?

### Specifications

You should also probably specify what you CAN and CANNOT do. (Can: make it look and act completely different; cannot: build databases in SQL lol.)

Do you remember where those other intake form quizzes you found a while ago are? Those were pretty helpful, although extremely *not* the vibe you were going for in terms of how that lady's website was.
