    - How soon does the new website need to launch? Please note any important dates, if relevant.
    - What is your current web address, if you have one?
3. Info about project
    - Describe what this project will be about. Broadly, what should be different about your website than now? Why?
        - Changed it to: Describe what this project will be about. What should be different about your website by the end of this project? Why?
    - Approximately how many pages or sections will the project consist of? 
    - What pages, if you know? Check all that apply below. This is by no means binding&mdash;it just gives me an idea of the scope of the project:
        - Home page
        - Top navigation
        - Footer
        - About
        - Contact
        - Blog
        - Blog post design
        - Portfolio, gallery, &/or projects page
        - Exhibit (e.g. interactive maps, etc.)
        - Events
        - Staff page
        - Site map
        - Other (please describe)
    - When you picture the ideal visitors to your website, who's clicking on your page? What are they looking to do on the site?
    - Identify 2-4 websites you like (colors, style, general message) similar to how you'd like your own to look. Give a sentence or two on what you like about each.
4. Style questions
    - Do you have a preferred color palette? If not, what is your color preference?
    - Do you have a logo, browser icon, or other graphics you'll be using?
5. Optional (talk about during meeting)
    - Color palette
        - Do you have a preferred color palette?
        - If not, do you have a color preference?
    - Vibe
        - What's the style & feel you'd like for your website?
            - (E.g. Students, readers, customers, male, female, younger, older, adventurous, reserved, artsy, traditional...)
            - Ideal audience (who's clicking on the page and what are they looking to do?)
        - What do you want people to think when they first log on?
        - what kind of vibe are you going for? What do you want people thinking when they log on? How is it different from what they're thinking now?
        - Your new site: the importance of first impression is paramount. How should visitors describe your new site? (Examples: modern, user friendly, bold, corporate, fun, forward thinking, innovative, bright, calming, elegant, clean, minimal, etc.)

*Only big thing I would change from the other intake forms' wording is noting that not all the questions have to be answered - we can talk about them IRL once we meet, I just need info on parts 1, 2, and 3 to get started talking.*

### Specifications

You should also probably specify what you CAN and CANNOT do. (Can: make it look and act completely different; cannot: build databases in SQL lol.)

Do you remember where those other intake form quizzes you found a while ago are? Those were pretty helpful, although extremely *not* the vibe you were going for in terms of how that lady's website was.

### Building
