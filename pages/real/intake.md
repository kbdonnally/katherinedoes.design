# Intake Form

Welcome! This intake form allows me to get a sense of your project and to then set up an initial meeting. Please fill out the form below, and I'll get back to you within 5 business days. Additionally, here's [a link to the form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLLtKFtWCYmRposqM3gGEMUcbz1Im86qz7_OZ-_5C53XQ1dA/viewform?usp=sf_link) if you'd prefer to fill it out in a new browser tab.

I look forward to speaking with you!

- Intake form is 4 sections: Contact Information, Project Logistics, Project Information, & Style Information
- This won't cover all the information that we talk about, but should allow us to hit the ground running after an initial meeting.
- Please don't feel that any of these questions are binding&mdash;they're just to get a sense of your project, but no worries if you don't know the answers to some.
